# TERfinder

The transcriptional and epigenetic regulators (TERs) play important roles in regulating marker genes expression in a variety of biological processes, including the occurrence of leukemia. At present, many deep learning modals have been developed to identify interactions between enhancers and promoters. However, a framework for identifying TERs as prognostic biomarkers in leukemia remains to be thoroughly investigated. Here, we developed TERfinder, a combination of deep learning framework to systematically identify the TERs as prognostic biomarkers in leukemia by integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic data. Using TERfinder, we identified elevated activity of the transcription factor (TF) family C/EBPs in leukemia cells. Furthermore, we constructed TER-Net, a transcriptional regulatory network with prognostic biomarkers, based on TFs (C/EBPs, CTCF, FOS, and JUNB) identified through TERfinder analysis. TERfinder provided novel insights into the prognostic biomarkers in leukemia. TERfinder highlights the potential of active TF s within TER-Net as therapeutic targets for leukemia treatment.
